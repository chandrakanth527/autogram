-   Proxy Server URL: Url of your proxy server. If you are using HighProxies account create the URL in the below format
    

username:password@ip:port

Eg: test:test@192.128.45.12:23303

  

-   Run Every: How frequently you want to repost the content to your instagram page. Once every 1 hour or once every 2 hours or once every 3 hours
    

-   For newer accounts never use the frequency as 30 mins as the chances of getting banned are high. In general never use this option since we saw a decline in the number of followers if too much content is posted
    

-   Starting Hour and Ending Hour: The time between which you want the tool to post. For Eg: You want the tool to repost only between 9 in the morning to 6 in the evening.
    
-   Offset Minutes: This will give an offset in minutes to the time of posting so that not all accounts overload the server at the same time and also to be sure that instagram will not detect unusual activity at once eg: if you have set the Run every to 1 hour and offset to 2 minutes, then the tool will repost the content at 9:02, 10:02, 11:02 and so on. Strongly suggested to use different offset intervals for each account
    
-   Examples
    

-   Run Every: 2 hours
    
-   Starting Hour: 6
    
-   Ending Hour: 15
    
-   Offset Minutes: 3
    
-   Will post the content once every 2 Hours between 6 AM and 3 PM with an offset of 3 minutes. Posts will published at 6:03, 8:03, 10:03, 12:03 and 14:03
    

-   Once all of the values are added click on Save to add the Instagram account to the list
